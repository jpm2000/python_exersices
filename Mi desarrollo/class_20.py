# map() function in Python is used to apply a specific function to each element of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) and returns a map object (which is an iterator).

"""
In Python, filter() is a built-in function used to construct an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. It offers a concise way to select specific items from collections based on a given condition.
How filter() Works:
Arguments:
filter() takes two arguments:
function: This is a function (or None) that will be applied to each element of the iterable. It should return a boolean value (True or False). If None is provided, filter() returns elements that are inherently truthy.
iterable: This is any iterable object, such as a list, tuple, string, or set.

even = list(filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, numbers))
print("pares: ", even)
